### 👋 Who I Am

I'm a Class 12 student and developer from Gurugram, India, obsessed with the intersection of **technical writing, functional code, and learning systems**.

My mission is to turn confusing IT concepts (like AI workflows and Cybersecurity principles) into clear, actionable resources for the next generation of builders. I build to learn, and I document everything to teach.
